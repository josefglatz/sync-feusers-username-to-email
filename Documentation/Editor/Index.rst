For Editors
===========

* Edit the website user records as any other record within your TYPO3 backend
* Take care of adding a valid email address in the username field of a website
  user record
* Follow the introductions above the username field (they depend on the
  configuration of your TYPO3 instance based on the project needs)
* Keep in mind, that a website user can only use a forgotPassword function on
  the website if the email is unique in your TYPO3 instance. Use the search box
  in the TYPO3 backend to search for an an email address. Use this method to
  easily check if a email address is used multiple times. (You can open the live
  search by pressing the :kbd:`Ctrl` + :kbd:`K` or :kbd:`Cmd` + :kbd:`K`
  keystroke)
